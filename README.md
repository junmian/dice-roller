# Dice Roller

## Overview
This app allows you to roll virtual dice with a click of a button. The player with the highest die value wins. In the event of equal values on both dice, it is a draw.  

## Randomness in Dice Rolls
Computers are deterministic machines, so it is physically impossible for computers to generate true randomness, at least not the kind we see in nature. To get a non-random computer to generate what appears to be a random number is called a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), which is an algorithm of a deterministic nature that uses mathematical formulas to simulate randomness.
